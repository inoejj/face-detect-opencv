# Face Detect Open-CV
This is a simple code to run face detection on a machine with low computational cost. The code uses Haar feature-based cascade classifiers from OpenCV for facial detection.

## Pre-requisite
1. Webcam
2. Python 3.6 and above

## How to use

1. Run face-extractor.py to extract some face using webcam.
2. Run face-train.py to train a classifier.
3. Run faces.py with webcam for facial recognition.

Please note that this is just a simple way for facial recognition. If you want to train a better model, I suggest using some convolutional neural network approaches.
